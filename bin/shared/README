Make sure you defined a path to the folder containing this README in the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH Linux (or Mac OS) environment variable.
To do so you should add a new string to ~/.bashrc file
(or ~/.bash_profile in Mac OS).
To open this file run in the terminal the following command:
'sudo nano ~/.bashrc'
Then in the end of the opened file add the following line:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:'absolute_path_to_the_folder_with_this_README'
